This application is a demonstration of how an ERC20 token can be created from scratch without the well-known zeppelin open library. The created smart contract is deployed on a hardhat network. Also, the smart contract is implemented with a constructor function where the initial supply, token name, and symbol are initially set.
The hardhat configuration allows developers to deploy the SC to different networks, including ganache and Sepolia testnet.
From the client-side perspective, we used the react framework to build a multi-component landing page where a user can connect their non-custodial wallet and send a portion of the created token to another address. In this project, to simplify the development process, I use Moralis service.
Furthermore, I created a deployment script to automatically update the ABI and Address of the contract in case other developers want to update/improve my initial version of the smart contract.
